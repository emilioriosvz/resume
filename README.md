# Hi, I’m Emilio! 👋

I’m an Engineer and CTO living in Barcelona 🇪🇸 — I love creating solutions that make a real difference for people. Some things that make me excited are software architecture, travelling and everything related to nature. Also I'm a new dad! So life is quite an adventure right now 👶

Building strong relationships and collaborating with diverse teams truly excites me.

🎥 I’m currently working at Storimake as a CTO, leading the technical team to build a platform where filmmakers and editors work with their clients to turn their video ideas into reality.

🌿 I’m expanding my skills as a gardener, and I also love exploring with my campervan and walking in nature 🚐🌲.

📫 Feel free to [reach out](mailto:emilioriosvz@gmail.com) if you’d like to collaborate or just chat about tech!
